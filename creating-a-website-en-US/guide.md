## #1 Understanding how it works a site

#### What is a domain?
Domain is a name that is used to locate and identify your space on the internet. The domain is the basis of all their identification on the Internet. It is the "name" of your website and your emails. It consists of a name and extension, for example:

**leaomozillaclubs.com**<br>
Name: leaomozillaclubs<br>
Extension: ".com"<br>

These names are usually called "domains" (for example: mozilla.org is our domain). 

The domain name was created in order to facilitate the memorization of computer Internet addresses. Without it, we would have to memorize a large number sequence.

#### What is a web hosting?
Web hosting is the storage service from a website and constant availability of the same on the Internet, that is, the hosting service will allow your site to be viewed 24 hours a day worldwide.
